Just for Greg and I to test why I can't export OpenCV Processing apps...

NOTE: If I open opencv_test in Processing 2.1, export as an app, then run the standalone app, I see nothing.  The app launches, but no window opens. The camera's green light doesn't turn on.

If I do the same with video_only, which does not use the OpenCV library, it does work -- you should just see video of yourself.
